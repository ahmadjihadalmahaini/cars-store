			The Bavarian Motor Company, commonly referred to as BMW (German: [ˈbe: ˈʔɛmˈve:] (hear)), is a German multinational company
			that produces cars and motorcycles. The company was founded in 1916 as a manufacturer of aircraft engines, which produced
			from 1917 through 1918 and again from 1933 to 1945. Cars are marketed under the BMW, Mini and Rolls-Royce brands, and
			motorcycles are marketed under the BMW Motorrad brand. It is one of the list of competitors in cars in the world and is
			the biggest competitor to other very popular German cars such as Mercedes, Audi, Volkswagen, Maybach and Smart. In 2015,
			BMW was the second largest car producer in the world, with 2,279,503 vehicles produced. BMW is headquartered in Munich
			and produces cars in Germany, Brazil, China, India, South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States and Mexico. The
			company has a proven track record in motorsports, particularly in Touring cars, Formula 1, sports cars and the Isle of
			Man TT. The company's logo is inspired by an airplane propeller, the German flag, and blue and white are the main colors
			of the Bavaria region, as the company's headquarters are in Munich in the state of Bavaria. The four-cylinder engine is
			an important part of BMW's legacy. These engines were present in most economic BMW cars, so the company's headquarters
			was designed in the form of a four-cylinder engine. The company has produced many models of cars over the years, and all
			of them are distinguished from other cars by the presence of a pair of front grille for the front of the car that resembles
			the shape of the college.

    The next day, McQueen is ordered by the town judge and medical doctor, Doc Hudson, to leave town immediately, but the local lawyer, Sally, requests that McQueen should instead be assigned community service to repave the road, to which Doc reluctantly agrees. Still in a rush to leave town, McQueen repaves the road shoddily, and is ordered to start again. During this time, he begins to warm up to the town, and befriends several of its residents. He learns that Radiator Springs was once a popular stop along U.S. Route 66 until it was bypassed with the construction of Interstate 40 and mostly forgotten, and that Doc was the Fabulous Hudson Hornet, a three-time Piston Cup champion whose career ended from a devastating crash in 1954. He bonds with Sally, who found happiness when she gave up a fast life in Los Angeles to live in Radiator Springs, and now dreams of putting the town back on the map. McQueen finishes repaving the road, reinvigorating the town's residents, and decides to spend an extra day in Radiator Springs with his new friends, but his time there is cut short when Mack and the media descend on the town. McQueen reluctantly leaves to reach California in time for the race while Sally expresses her disappointment with Doc upon discovering that he was responsible for tipping off the media to McQueen's whereabouts, and she and the others, sad about the departure of their new friend, go to sleep, while Doc, alone by the traffic light, regrets his actions.
